Q.1 How does Cross-Validation helps in testing models? 
It helps to prevent overfitting by providing a more robust estimate of model's performance on unseen data. 
It is used to compare different models and select the one that performs best on average. 

Q.2 Determine the least appropriate scenario to model using a Poisson Distribution? 
The scenario where the events are not independent or the average rate is not known. 

Q.3 Is Relu a Continous and Differential function? 
No. ReLu is differntiable at all places except for z=0. 
RelU is a Continuous function

Q.4 L2 Penalty in Ridge and L1 penalty in Lasso Regression? 
L2 Penalty: 
It uses sum of squares of the parameters 
It shrinks coeffecients towards zero but never to absloute zero. 
Ridge encourages sum to be small 

L1 Penalty: 
It uses sum of absolute value of the parameters 
Lasso encourages sum to be small 

Q.5 Tests of Significance? 
T-Tests: Checks whether a sample is from a population or whether multiple samples indicate their populations are equal.
F-Tests: Investigates whether two populations are equal based on the variances of two samples from those populations.

Q.6 P-Value
P values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis.
p < 0.05; Reject Null Hypothesis 

Q.7 IWD Coding Challenge? 
In how many ways can we replace a string ex. ?2 where ? can be replaced with 0-9 such that the numbers it should not be equal to number preceding it and number 
following it?

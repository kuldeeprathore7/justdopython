# Q1. An extra day is added to the calendar almost every four years as February 29, and the day is called a leap day. It corrects the calendar for the fact that our planet takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the sun. A leap year contains a leap day.

# In the Gregorian calendar, three conditions are used to identify leap years:

# 1. The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
# 2. The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
# 3. The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

# This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap



def leap_year(year):
  if year%4 == 0:
    if year%100 == 0:
      if year%400 == 0:
        return True
      else:
        return False
    else:
      return True
  else:
    return False


Example Use Case: 
years = [2000, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, 2500,2004]
for year in years:
  if leap_year(year) == True:
    print ("year is leap year")
  else:
    print ("year is not a leap year")

Q.3 What is the difference between union and join?

2) JOIN retains duplicate rows while UNION removes duplicate rows
3) JOIN maintains referential integrity between related tables, while UNION does not as it combines unrelated data.

5) JOIN combine rows from multiple tables based on a related column while UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements

Q.10 What is the difference between HSQL and normal SQL? 
Hive is better for analyzing complex data sets. SQL is better for analyzing less complicated data sets very quickly. 
Hive doesn't support OLTP. SQL supports Online Transactional Processing (OLTP).
Hive is a data warehouse project built on top of Hadoop that uses HSQL mostily for BigData where SQL is a common programming language not used for BigData. 
Hive queries can have high latency because Hive runs batch processing via Hadoop whereas SQL queries has low latency for less data.

Q.1 What is an outlier? How are various ways to detect it ? 
Q.2 Which is better Logistic Regression or Random Forest Regression and Why? 
LOGISTIC REGRESSION: (Supervised Classification algorithm)
It predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable.
Instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1
Instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an "S" shaped logistic function

RANDOM FOREST : (Supervised Classification/Regression algorithm)
It contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
It takes the prediction from each tree and based on the majority votes of predictions, it predicts the final output.
The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.

BETTER: 
1) Random forest is better since it is less sensitive to outliers and also it can handle missing values and non linear relationships between 
dependent and independent variables whereas losgistic regression assumes linear relationship.
2) Random forest does not require feature scaling whereas LR requires feature scaling for optimal performance.
3) Random forest  is more accurate and robust
4) Random forest can handle large amount of data efficiently whereas LR is computationally expensive for large amounts of data.

Q.3 How would you deal with null values? 
Q.4 What is the difference between a list and tuple?

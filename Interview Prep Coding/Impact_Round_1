Q.1 What is the difference between dense_rank, rank and row_number? 
Q.2 Write a python query to join two tables? 
result = table1.merge(table_2,  how = 'left', on = 'id' ) 
cols = ['cst_name', 'cst_age', 'cst_credit_score']
result[cols]

Q.3 Write a python query to get average cst credit score and count the people with their age? 
age_count = df.groupby(by= 'age').size().reset_index(name = 'age_count', drop= True)
age_average = df.groupby(by= 'age').aggregate('cst_credit_score').mean()
result = df1.merge( df2, how = 'left, on = 'age') 
cols = ['age', 'age_count', 'age_average']
result[cols]

Q.4 Replaces null values in a dataframe with 0 ? 
result = df.isna()
result['column'] = 0 
or 
result = df.fillna(0)

Q.5 What is the difference between loc and iloc? 
loc uses label based indexing whereas iloc use position based indexing
df.loc[df[transaction_id] = 'txn10002', quantity_sold]
df.iloc[-3:6]

Q.6 How will you remove duplicate rows in table?
1) USING ROW_NUMBER/RANK Function
WITH CTE([FirstName], 
    [LastName], 
    [Country], 
    DuplicateCount)
AS (SELECT [FirstName], 
           [LastName], 
           [Country], 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY [FirstName], 
                                          [LastName], 
                                          [Country]
           ORDER BY ID) AS DuplicateCount
    FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee])
DELETE FROM CTE
WHERE DuplicateCount > 1;

2) USING GROUP BY AND MAX CLAUSE: 
DELETE FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee]
    WHERE ID NOT IN
    (
        SELECT MAX(ID) AS MaxRecordID
        FROM [SampleDB].[dbo].[Employee]
        GROUP BY [FirstName], 
                 [LastName], 
                 [Country]
    );


Q.7 What is difference between primary key and unique keys in a table? 
Primary key: A key that uniquely identifies each record in a table but cannot store NULL values
There can be only one Primary key in a table
It can generate a clustered index 
It cannot generate a Non-clustered index

Unique key: Prevents duplicate values in a column but can store NULL values
There can be more than one unique keys in a table
It cannot generate a clustered index
It can generate a Non-clustered index

Q.8 Write a query to get total quantity sold and total sales? 
select transaction_date, sum(quantity_sold) as total_sold, 
sum(final_price*quantity_sold) as total_revenue
from cte 
group by transaction_date

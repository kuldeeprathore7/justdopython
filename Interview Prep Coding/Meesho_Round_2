Q.1 Can you please tell about a project that you are proud of? 
Q.2
Consider a database schema with three tables:
 'employees' (with columns for employee_id, employee_name, and department_id)
 'departments' (with columns for department_id and department_name), 
'salaries' (with columns for employee_id, salary_amount, and salary_date).

 Write a SQL query to find the average salary for each department for the year 2023, excluding departments with fewer than 5 employees. 

Additionally, include the department name, the total number of employees in each department, and the total amount paid in salaries for that department in 2023. Sort the result by the average salary in descending order

With a as ( 
Select department_id, total_employees
From ( 
Select department_id, count(employee_id) as total_employees
From 'employees' 
Group by department_id
)tt 
Where total_employees >= 5 
), 

select  e.department_id, d.department_name, a.total_employees, sum(b.total_salary) as total_salary, avg(salary_amount) as avg_salary 

From salaries s
Left join 'employees' e on e. Employee_id = s.employee_id
Left join departments d on d.department_id = e.department_id
Left join a on a.department_id = e.department_id

Where extract(year from salary_date) = 2023 
And a.department_id is not null 

Group by e.department_id, d.department_name, total_employees 
Order by avg(salary_amount)  desc

Q.1 Given a list. arr = [3,4,5,2,6]. Give me all pairs of elements that sum equals 7
arr = [3,4,5,2,6]

def pair(arr): 
  brr = []
  
  for i in range(0, len(arr)): 
    for j in range(i+1, len(arr)): 
      if arr[i]+ arr[j] == 7: 
        brr.append((arr[i], arr[j]))
  print(brr)

pair(arr) 

Q.2 
select s.name, m.subject, m.marks
from ( 
select s.name, m.subject, m.marks, rank() over(partition by m.name order by m.marks desc) as rnk
from Marks as m 
left join Student as s  on S.Id = m.student_id
) tt
where rnk = 1 

Q.3 
select s.name, sum(marks) 
from Marks as m 
left join Student as s  on S.Id = m.student_id
group by s.name

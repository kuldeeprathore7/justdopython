Q.1 Replace the digits in the string with #
consider a string that will have digits in that, we need to remove all the not digits and replace the digits with #? 
import re
string = '#a$#b%c%1#'
result = re.sub(r'\D', '', string)
final = re.sub(r'\d', '#', result)
print(final)

Q.2 Students marks dashboard
consider the marks list of class students given two lists
Students = ['student1','student2','student3','student4','student5','student6','student7','student8','student9','student10']
Marks = [45, 78, 12, 14, 48, 43, 45, 98, 22, 80]
from the above two lists the Student[0] got Marks[0], Student[1] got Marks[1] and so your task is to print the name of students 

a. Who got top 5 ranks, in the descending order of marks
b. Who got least 5 ranks, in the increasing order of marks
d. Who got marks between >25th percentile <75th percentile, in the increasing order of marks

Sol. import numpy as np
dictionary = dict(zip(Students, Marks))
sorted_dict = sorted(dictionary.items(), key =lambda x:x[1])

for (student, marks) in sorted_dict[::-1][:5]:
  print(f'{student}: {marks}')

for (student, marks) in sorted_dict[:5]:
  print(f'{student}: {marks}')

marks_arr = np.array(Marks)
percentile_25 = np.percentile(marks_arr, 25)
percentile_75 = np.percentile(marks_arr, 75)
for (student, marks) in sorted_dict:
  if marks > percentile_25 and marks < percentile_75:
    print(f'{student}: {marks}')

Q.3  How to calculate standard deviation of values?
list = [1,2,3,4,10,19,20,22]
Sol. import statistics
result = statistics.stdev(list)
print(result)

Q.4 How to remove duplicate values by a given Subject and keep the last record for each subject?
data = {'Subject': ['Mathematics', 'English', 'Physics', 'Mathematics', 'Physics'],
   'Marks': [79, 56, 91,99,45] }
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Sol. df_sorted = df.sort_values(by = 'Subject')
df3= df_sorted.drop_duplicates(subset= 'Subject', keep='last')

Q.5 How to find out cumulative summation of values for each row?
values = [3, 4, 10, 7, 2, 0]
Sol. import numpy as np
array = np.cumsum(values)
print(array)

Q.6	Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
•	Equilateral: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
•	Isosceles: It's a triangle with sides of equal length.
•	Scalene: It's a triangle with sides of differing lengths.
•	Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
Sol. Select CASE   WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
        WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
        WHEN A = B OR A = C OR B = C THEN 'Isosceles'
        ELSE 'Scalene' end as type
     From Triangles 

Q.7 You have data of people who have applied for a lottery ticket. The data consists of their ticket number. 
You have to choose winners by selecting the people present in rows divided by 3 or 7, but not both.
Sol. Select ticket_number
From ( 
Select  ticket_number, row_number() over(order by ticket_number) as row
From table 
) tt 
Where ( row%3 = 0 or row%7 = 0) and (row%21 <> 0 )

Q.8 There are two tables:
Table Dogs
 id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
 Table Cats
 id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
 name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
Write a query that selects all distinct pet names
Sol. Select name
From Dogs 
Union 
Select name 
From Cats 

Q.9 Given the 2 tables:
Table_Class (
Class_Id int
,Class_desc string
) Table_Attendance (
Class_id string
,Student_id int
,Class_Date datetime
) What would the result be of executing the given SQL?
Select * from Table_Class as a inner join Table_Attendance as b  on a.Class_id=b.Class_id
Sol. This will throw Sql run time error since the data type of Class_id are different from both the tables. 
One is int and the other is string type. We need to cast one of the two in order to get results

Q.10 There are two tables, Table 1 has two columns A & B , and Table 2 has two columns C & D, there is no common join key, how can I get the 4 columns together beside each other?
Sol. SELECT A, B, NULL AS C, NULL AS D
FROM Table1
UNION ALL
SELECT NULL AS A, NULL AS B, C, D
FROM Table2;

Q.11 The table given below has 2 columns, item | sales, there are say 20 distinct items, how will we get the % sales contribution of each of the items?
Sol. WITH total_sales as ( 
Select sum(sales) as t_sales
From table
) 
Select item, 100.0*sales/t_sales as percent_contribution
From tables 
Join  total_sales on 1=1 

Q.12 1.	A table is given to you which has 3 columns, item -region – sales (21 rows - 7 items), there are three distinct Regions, Region 1, Region 2 and Region 3 in the table, 
how can we get sales for each item across region (Each region in a column) ? What will be the resulting number of rows after this?
Sol. SELECT 
    item,
    SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'Region 1' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Region_1_Sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'Region 2' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Region_2_Sales,
    SUM(CASE WHEN region = 'Region 3' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS Region_3_Sales
FROM 
    Table
GROUP BY 
    Item 
The resulting rows would be 7 since there are 7 distinct items.

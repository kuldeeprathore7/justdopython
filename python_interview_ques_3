Q.21 CASTING IN Python? 
y = int(2.8) #y will be 2
x = float(1) #x will be 1.0
z = str(3.0) #z will be '3.0'

Q.22 STRINGS IN Python? 
NOTE: String in Python are treated as arrays of bytes representing unicode characters
E.G  a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])

IN in Strings 
To check if a string is present in another string, we can use IN
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")

NEGATIVE INDEXING 
NOTE: Indexing exclude the last character
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])

MODIFYING STRINGS 
a = "Hello, World!"
a.upper() E.g 
a.lower() E.g 
a.strip() E.g print(a.strip())
a.replace() E.g print(a.replace("H", "J"))
a.split() E.g print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']

CONCATENATE STRING
E.g a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + " " + b
print(c)

FORMATTING STRINGS
The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are. 
E.g myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(3, 567, 49.95))

ESCAPE CHARACTERS
To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."

STRING METHODS
capitalize(): Converts the first character to upper case
count(): Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string
find()/index(): Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
isalnum(): Returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric
isalpha()	Returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet
isdigit()	Returns True if all characters in the string are digits
islower()	Returns True if all characters in the string are lower case
join()	Joins the elements of an iterable to the end of the string
split()	Splits the string at the specified separator, and returns a list
translate() returns a string where some specified characters are replaced with the character described in a dictionary

Q.23 PYTHON TUPLES? 
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
A tuple can contain different data types
E.g thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "orange", "kiwi", "melon", "mango")
print(thistuple[:4])

Q.2
Find the total transaction volume happnened in each quarter for each alogoritm? 
Ans 
select algorithm, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 1  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q1, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 2  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q2, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 3  then volume end),6) as transactions_Q3, 
TRUNCATE(sum(case when quarter(dt) = 4 then volume end),6) as transactions_Q4

from transactions as t 
left join coins c on t.coin_code = c.code 
WHERE  YEAR(dt) = 2020
group by algorithm 
ORDER BY algorithm

Q.1 Find the total hours work on weekends?

select emp_id, sum(hours) as work_hours
from ( 
select emp_id, current_d, truncate((hour(logout_timestamp) +  (minute(logout_timestamp)/60)) -  (hour(login_timestamp) +  (minute(login_timestamp)/60)),0) as hours

from ( 
select a.emp_id, CAST(a.timestamp AS DATE) as current_d, MIN(timestamp) AS login_timestamp, 
MAX(timestamp) AS logout_timestamp
from attendance a 
group by a.emp_id, CAST(a.timestamp AS DATE)
) tt 
where weekday(current_d) in (5,6)
) tt 
group by emp_id 
order by sum(hours) desc

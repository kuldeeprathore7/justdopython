Q.12 a) Is it possible to add and remove items from sets? 
Yes, you can modified values in sets but you can surely add and remove values from sets. 

b) Access Sets
Sets cannot be accessed by using index or key, they can be accessed by using for loop 
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in thisset:
  print(x)

c) Add Set Items
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
thisset.update(tropical) # can also use thisset.add("lichi")
print(thisset)

d) Remove Items 
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
thisset.discard("banana") # thisset.remove("banana")
print(thisset)

e) Join Sets
set1 = {"a", "b" , "c"}
set2 = {1, 2, 3}
set3 = set1.union(set2 #set1.update(set2) #x.intersection_update(y) # x.intersection(y) #x.symmetric_difference(y)
print(set3)

Q.1 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLASSIFICATION AND REGRESSION 
Classification                                      Regression 
Discrete Output Variable                            Continous Output Variable 
Ex. Spam Classification                             Ex. House Price, Engagement Score prediction 
Ex. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes                Liner Regression, Ridge, Lasso Regression 
F-1 Score, Precision, Recall                        R2-score, MSE, MAPE

Q.2) What is RandomForestClassifer? How does it works? 
When using Random Forest for classification, each tree gives a classification or a “vote.” 
The forest chooses the classification with the majority of the “votes.” 
When using Random Forest for regression, the forest picks the average of the outputs of all trees.
There is low (or no) correlation between the decision trees that make up the larger Random Forest model. One tree causing error does not affect the whole decision.

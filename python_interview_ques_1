Q.1) INHERITANCE AND POLYMORPHISM? 
INHERITANCE: Allows to define a class that inherits all the properties and method from the parent class 
Below Student class is inheriting properties from the Parent class Person. 
class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname
  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)
#Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:
x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

class Student(Person):
  pass
x = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
x.printname()

POLYMORPHISM: Class with Methods can be used by other classes. It is the property of having many forms. 
Below you can see different classes with the same method. With polymorphism we are able to use only a single statement to use the method from all the 3 classes. 
CLASS POLYMORPHISM: 
class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Drive!")

class Boat:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat class
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane class

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()

2) What is Method Overriding in python? 
It allows a child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. 
Below, move method in boat and plane are overriding move method of Vehicle Class. 
class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  print(x.brand) #POLYMORPHISM 
  print(x.model)
  x.move()
